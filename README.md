📝 Notes App

A clean and minimal multi-tab Notes Management App built using modern frontend technologies.
This app allows users to create, organize, search, archive, and manage notes efficiently — all powered by Local Storage (no backend required).

✨ Features

📝 Create, edit, and delete notes

📂 Multi-tab view:

Active Notes

Archived Notes

Trash

🔍 Real-time Search functionality

♻️ Restore notes from Archive or Trash

🗑️ Permanent delete from Trash

💾 Persistent data using Browser LocalStorage

⚡ Instant UI updates without page reload

📱 Responsive Design (Mobile + Desktop)

🧠 How It Works

This application uses Local Storage to simulate a backend database.

All notes are stored as JSON in the browser.

Each note contains:

id

title

content

createdAt

isArchived

isDeleted

Data is filtered dynamically based on state to show:

Active notes → !isArchived && !isDeleted

Archived notes → isArchived

Trash notes → isDeleted

Search works by filtering notes based on title/content match.
